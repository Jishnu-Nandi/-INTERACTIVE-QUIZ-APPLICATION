#DESCRIPTION

**Overview**:

The Interactive Quiz Application is a front-end web-based quiz tool developed using core web technologies â€” HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to answer multiple-choice questions related to web development and receive immediate feedback. The application includes a scoring system, a visually appealing background, and a user-friendly interface. The project was built as part of a task to demonstrate basic frontend development skills and client-side interactivity.

**Tools & Technologies Used**:

HTML5: Used to structure the content of the quiz, including the question section, options list, and result display.

CSS3: Used for styling the application. Features include layout design, hover effects, responsive styling, and the implementation of a background image.

JavaScript (ES6): Used for all interactive logic, such as question loading, answer validation, score tracking, and feedback display.

Visual Studio Code: Code editor used for developing and testing the project.

Web Browser (Chrome/Firefox): Used to view, test, and debug the application.

Image Asset: A background image was included to enhance the visual design.

**Features Implemented**:

Dynamic Question Loading: The application loads questions from a JavaScript array, displaying them one at a time in sequence.

Answer Validation & Feedback: When the user selects an option, the app immediately marks it as correct (green) or incorrect (red), and displays the correct answer if needed.

Score Calculation: A score counter tracks the number of correct answers and displays the final result at the end of the quiz.

Quiz Restart Functionality: A button allows the user to retake the quiz after completion.

Responsive & Styled UI: The app uses modern CSS styling for buttons, hover effects, borders, and layout. A semi-transparent quiz card overlays a background image for a professional look.

Background Image: The application includes a full-page background image set using CSS, improving aesthetic appeal.

**Development Process**:

The application was developed in three main parts:

HTML: The page layout was created using semantic elements including a container for the quiz, a question display area, a list for options, and a feedback/result section.

CSS: Styles were added to ensure readability, interactivity, and a visually polished design. A background image was set using background: url(...), with adjustments for coverage and alignment. The quiz container uses a semi-transparent background for contrast.

JavaScript: Logic was written to dynamically populate questions, listen for user interactions, compare answers, and update the score and UI based on correctness. The loadQuestion() function loads each question, and the selectOption() function handles answer validation and feedback.

**Conclusion**:

This project successfully demonstrates how to create a responsive and interactive quiz application using only frontend technologies. It provides a strong foundation for extending features such as timers, progress bars, and backend score saving in future versions. The use of real-time feedback and a professional interface ensures a smooth and engaging user experience.
